On my github [repository](http://github.com/rikiji]) you can now find an alpha version of my c-to-epub conversion tool.
c2epub is a tool able to generate ebooks in the EPUB format packaging c source code.

It is different from other epub generating software since default font of generated ebooks is a fixed width one. Blank lines, spaces, tabs are preserved and it provides C syntax highlight.
You can choose to package a group of source files together or process them one by one creating different epubs.

Run it with -h to get the usage help. Default is single output file, no syntax highlight

    usage: c2epub [options] [source files...]
    source files have to be in the same directory you run c2epub.
      -t title package title (output filename base)
      -g       enable grayscale
      -m       multiple files output
      -h       print this help
      -v       print version information

Get source and binary [here](http://github.com/rikiji/c2epub).
