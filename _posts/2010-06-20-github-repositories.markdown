I just created a new github repository to host source code of [rwiimote](http://www.rikiji.it/post/12), so who's interested can take a look at the [source](http://github.com/rikiji/rwiimote/blob/master/ext/rwiimote/rwiimote.c) easily.

I also added a repo named [rmotion](url=http://github.com/rikiji/rmotion) to host code related to [this](url=http://www.rikiji.it/post/14) previous entry.
The leading `r` as you already have understood means that it will be packaged as a ruby gem. I already got a full working version but it does need some more testing before release, so keep looking for updates.
