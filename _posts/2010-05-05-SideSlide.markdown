On [this page](http://rikiji.it/data/sideslide/) you can find a live demo of a script emulating a gui effect well known to users of a particular music player. Hovering with your mouse the images will cause them to slide one by one. Faster you move faster they will swap.
I wrote it to be really easy to setup, just add <img> tags withing a parent class "sideslide" like this:

    <div class="sideslide"> 
    <img src="m/Alive - Daft Punk.jpg"> 
    <img src="m/Daft Club - Daft Punk.jpg"> 
    <img src="m/Discovery - Daft Punk.jpg"> 
    <img src="m/Homework - Daft Punk.jpg"> 
    <img src="m/Human After All - Daft Punk.jpg"> 
    </div>

Don't forget to include [sideslide.js](http://rikiji.it/data/sideslide/sideslide.js) and jQuery to your page. Chek the live demo to find out more.
