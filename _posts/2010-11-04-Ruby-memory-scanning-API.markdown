title: Ruby memory scanning API
---
I'm writing down some code to access other processes memory from ruby scripts.
Even if it's still in an early form, i'm pushing regular (working?) updates on [this github repo](https://github.com/rikiji/ruby-memscan).
The extension won't definitely work on anything different than x86 Linux.
